# tensorflow_fundamentals
In this notebook, we're going to cover some of the most fundamental concepts of tensors using TensorFlow
* Introduction to tensors
* Getting information from tensors
* Manipulating tensors
* Tensors & NumPy
* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)
* Using GPUs with TensorFlow (or TPUs)
